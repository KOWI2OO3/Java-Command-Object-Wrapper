# Java Command Object Wrapper

Command line arguments or commands structured by classes! 

Your classes will define the structure of commands fed in through the cli. A class is its own command with methods being subcommands and their parameters act as arguments on the command, all without you needing to worry about the logic of the command parsing and execution!
